# Palladium OS

---

**Palladium OS** is a Custom ROM based on Android 11/12/12L and the element palladium. Palladium OS is a community-driven OS. Anyone can request or remove a feature. This flexible system is implemented by a system app,the PalladiumOS-Community with which the users can interact/create polls and posts for discussion. Lastly, this is complemented by the Meteor Drop OTAs. These are exclusive OTAs which add new features and easter eggs inside the OS based on the suggestions from pdC. Enough pondering now, hop in and experience Android at its finest!
